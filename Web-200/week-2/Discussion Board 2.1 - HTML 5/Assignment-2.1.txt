Initial Post:
    - Due Date: Day 4 of the week by 11:59 PM (CST/CDT).

    - Please put your last name in the subject line of your post along with a title that relates to the discussion topic.

    - The main post must be at least 250 words in length.

    - Your post must be substantive and demonstrate your ability to apply the knowledge and critical thinking skills you have gained.

    - Research is a required component.  All statements, opinions, and positions must be backed by a creditable source.  
    A creditable source is written by someone who is an expert in their discipline and is free of errors and bias.  
    Usually, this means that blog authors, content creators (YouTube), Wikipedia postings, 
    and random answers found on the Internet do not count as creditable.  While ChatGPT and other 
    OpenAI tools are producing amazing results, at this time they should not be considered creditable.  
    Book authors, blogs written by industry leaders (their credentials must be verified), and scholarly 
    journals can all be considered creditable sources and used in your writings.

Replies:
 - Due Date: Day 7 of the week by 11:59 PM (CST/CDT).

 - Reply to at least two other posts during the week, spread out over multiple days.

 - There is no specific word count for replies, but they should be at least a couple 
 sentences in length, be thoughtful, and extend the conversation.  The easiest way to 
 extend the conversation is to end the reply with a question.  Does that make sense?

Important note:
    Replies posted on the last day of the week do not give others a 
    chance to read or respond to your message.  Please be courteous and post your 
    responses early enough in the week so others have time to read and respond.
